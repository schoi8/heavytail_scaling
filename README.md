# heavytail_scaling
These are MATLAB codes used to analyze the interaction data of honeybees and humans. 

The folder named "data processing" contains codes used to process the raw data so that they can be analyzed using the codes in the folder "analysis".

The folder named "analysis" contains codes used to analyze the processed data to produce the results of our study. expt_data_analysis examines the scaling of the interaction time distribution and the mean interaction time distribution. single_pair_analysis fits the pair interaction time distribution to a hyperexponential distribution.
